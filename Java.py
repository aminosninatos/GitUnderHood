Java
-----
Every java application has to have at least one class and at one main method per application.

Execusion procedure
-------------------
Step 1:
javac + Filename.java
Step 2:
java + Filename // execute without add .java

Access Modificators
--------------------
For class only two : public : the class is visible everywhere, defaut : class visible only in the same package.
For variables four : public : visible everywhere, private: visible only in the same class, proctected : visible
in the same package and visibile for the child classes, defaut : visible only in the same package.

Encapsulation
-------------
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods)
together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and
can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
